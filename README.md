# ApocalypseSimulation

This repository contains the code for an interactive zombie apocalypse simulation that I made for a class assignment.
The code uses concepts of autonomous agents and vectors. The language used is C# in Unity. Enjoy spawning zombies for those humans :)
Do give it about a minute or so to load up. Thank you for checking out this fun little simulation.
